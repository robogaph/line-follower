# line-follower
A line follower consists of an infrared light sensor and an infrared LED. It works by illuminating a surface with infrared light; the sensor then picks up the reflected infrared radiation and, based on its intensity, determines the reflectivity of the surface in question. Light-colored surfaces will reflect more light than dark surfaces, resulting in their appearing brighter to the sensor. This allows the sensor to detect a dark line on a pale surface, or a pale line on a dark surface. You can use a line follower to help your robot navigate along a marked path, or in any other application involving discerning the boundary between two high-contrast surfaces.
